# RESTAPI Smartcity project - Bepway

## TODO for better documentation [not mandatory]

- Group the operations based on tags :

So the Password and Todo controllers will disappear as they both are parts of the UserController. They will then merge with it in the doc page but will definitely have another URI.

- Sort the operations based on their http method :

So all operations will be correctly sorted (every GET first, followed in order by POST, PUT and DELETE)
